# OEC-An-Online-Ensemble-Classifier-for-Mining-Data-Streams-with-Noisy-Labels
This is the code for the paper entitled "OEC: An Online Ensemble Classifier for Mining Data Streams with Noisy Labels"


# File description
Compare to SOTA: We compare our proposed algorithm with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. 

Libraries: The river library is used by the MSANA, ARF-ADWIN, SRP-ADWIN, and EFDT algorithms.

ablation experiment: Regarding the ablation experiments analyzing different scenarios (noise only, concept drift only, both)

olsvm: A library for online SVM based on the ramp loss function.
